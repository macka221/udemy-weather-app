## How To Run Application

On an arch Linux system I find that it was easiest to run this application through a tether (i.e. a chord through the charging port). In order to start the application fllow the commands exactly from below:

```bash
$ yarn # Install dependencies
# ...
$ yarn start --tunnel --clear # The cache will sometimes not clear on a refresh during tethering, thus you must clear before each run.
# ...
# Scan the QR code that comes up and you should be good to go!
```
```
